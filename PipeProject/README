This is a single function python script designed to take an input file including coordinates and a pipe designated to that coordinate.
The asterik is the "water source" of the image and any alphabetical letter is a sink connected to the water system.

The function starts at the asterik and checks all 4 directions to see if those pipes can be filled with water. If the pipe is connected in a way that makes sense (two opening touching eachother)
the pipe then becomes "filled" and is added to a dictionary called fillmap. It is also sent to a stack that allows the while loop to know to continue running until the stack is completely empty.
This repeats until all connected pipes are determined, at which point the function will return all connected sinks in alphabetical order.
